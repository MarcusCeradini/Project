        Einsteinium (Es, atomic number 99) is a synthetic, radioactive element named in honor of the renowned physicist **Albert Einstein**. It was first discovered in **1952** by a team of American scientists who were examining the fallout from the first hydrogen bomb explosion, known as the **Ivy Mike** test. The element was identified in the debris as a result of neutron capture by **uranium** during the massive nuclear reaction. Later, einsteinium was produced in nuclear reactors by bombarding **plutonium** or **curium** with neutrons. As a member of the **actinide series**, it is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table and shares chemical properties with other actinides such as **californium** and **fermium**. The most stable isotope, einsteinium-252, has a half-life of about 471 days. Because it is extremely radioactive, difficult to produce, and exists only in minute amounts, einsteinium has no practical commercial applications. However, it is valuable in scientific research, especially in studying the chemistry of heavy elements and the synthesis of even heavier elements. Its discovery deepened understanding of nuclear fission and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.
