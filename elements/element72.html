        Hafnium, element number 72 with the symbol Hf, is a lustrous, silvery-gray transition metal that often occurs alongside zirconium and was one of the last stable elements to be discovered, finally identified in 1923 by Dirk Coster and George de Hevesy through X-ray spectroscopy of zirconium ore, with its name derived from "Hafnia," the Latin name for Copenhagen. 1  Chemically, hafnium closely resembles zirconium, making their separation challenging, but it is denser and has a significantly higher neutron absorption cross-section, a property that makes it crucial for control rods in nuclear reactors, particularly in naval submarines and pressurized water reactors. 2  Beyond nuclear applications, hafnium's high melting point and resistance to corrosion at high temperatures make it valuable in superalloys for aerospace components, such as rocket nozzles, and as an additive to improve the adherence of protective oxide scales on other high-temperature alloys. 3  Additionally, hafnium compounds are used as insulators in microchips and as catalysts in polymerization reactions, showcasing its importance in both nuclear technology and advanced materials science despite its relative scarcity. 4  Â
