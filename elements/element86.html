        Radon is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and highly radioactive noble gas with the chemical symbol Rn and atomic number 86, located in Group 18 of the periodic table. It was discovered in 1900 by German physicist Friedrich Ernst Dorn while studying the decay of radium, and was later identified as a distinct element. Radon is formed naturally as a decay product of uranium and thorium, especially from radium-226, and it typically seeps from soil, rock, and groundwater into the atmosphere. The most stable isotope, radon-222, has a half-life of about 3.8 days and emits alpha particles. Though it dissipates quickly outdoors, radon can accumulate to dangerous levels in enclosed spaces such as basements and poorly ventilated buildings, where it becomes a serious health hazard. Long-term exposure to high concentrations of radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer after smoking. Because of this, radon testing and mitigation are critical for indoor air quality in many homes, especially in areas with high natural uranium content in the soil. Despite its risks, radon has been used in some forms of cancer treatment, particularly in radiotherapy, although safer alternatives are more common today. Due to its radioactivity and health impacts, radon is both a subject of scientific research and a public health concern, and awareness campaigns have helped promote testing and remediation.
