Mercury, element number 80 with the symbol Hg and also known as quicksilver due to its mobility, is a unique and fascinating heavy, silvery-white metal that stands out as the only metallic element liquid at standard temperature and pressure. 1  Known to ancient civilizations as far back as 1500 BCE in Egypt and the East, its name originates from the Roman god Mercury, while its chemical symbol Hg derives from the Greek "hydrargyrum," meaning "water-silver," aptly describing its liquid, metallic appearance. 2  Historically, mercury has been employed in a wide array of applications, some practical and others rooted in alchemical beliefs, where it was considered a fundamental component of all metals and sought after for transmutation into gold; ancient uses ranged from pigments like cinnabar (mercuric sulfide) used in cave paintings and cosmetics, to medicinal purposes in ancient China and India, and even misguided attempts at achieving immortality. 3  The Romans utilized mercury in cosmetics and their mines as penal institutions, while around 1000 CE, it was discovered to be effective in extracting gold through amalgamation, a process still used in artisanal gold mining today. 4  The invention of the barometer by Torricelli in 1643 and the mercury thermometer by Fahrenheit in 1720 significantly boosted its scientific use, leading to applications in various instruments, electrical switches, and fluorescent lighting. However, the recognition of mercury's significant toxicity, causing neurological damage and other severe health issues, has led to the phasing out of many of its traditional uses, such as in thermometers, barometers, and some industrial processes like chlorine and sodium hydroxide production. Despite these restrictions, mercury still finds essential applications in dental amalgams (though their use is declining), certain electrical switches, specialized laboratory equipment, and in some industrial processes as a catalyst, highlighting a complex legacy of utility and hazard associated with this intriguing liquid metal. 5  Â
