        Ruthenium, element number 44 with the symbol Ru, is a rare, hard, silvery-white transition metal belonging to the platinum group. It was discovered in 1844 by Karl Karlovich Klaus, a Russian chemist, while analyzing residues from platinum ore sourced from the Ural Mountains; the name derives from "Ruthenia," the Latin name for Russia. Ruthenium is resistant to corrosion and does not tarnish at room temperature. It is primarily used as a hardening agent in alloys with platinum and palladium to enhance their wear resistance, particularly in electrical contacts and some jewelry. Ruthenium also serves as a crucial catalyst in various industrial chemical processes, including the production of ammonia and acetic acid, and is used to coat anodes in electrochemical cells for chlorine production. Additionally, ruthenium compounds are being explored for applications in solar cells and even in medical treatments.
