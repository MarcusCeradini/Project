        Americium (Am, atomic number 95) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after the Americas, following the naming pattern of **europium**, another lanthanide. It was first discovered in **1944** by Glenn T. Seaborg, Albert Ghiorso, Ralph A. James, and Leon O. Morgan at the **University of California, Berkeley**, while working on the Manhattan Project. They produced americium by bombarding **plutonium-239** with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Americium is part of the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. Its most common isotope, **americium-241**, has a half-life of about 432 years and is widely used in **commercial smoke detectors** due to its ability to emit alpha particles. It is also used in **industrial gauges** to measure thickness or moisture and in **research** involving nuclear materials. Although useful, americium is highly radioactive and must be handled with extreme care. Its discovery marked an important step in the development of transuranic elements and expanded our understanding of nuclear chemistry, helping scientists explore the synthesis and behavior of even heavier elements.
