        Tennessine (symbol Ts, atomic number 117) is a superheavy synthetic element and one of the rarest elements ever created. It belongs to the halogen group (Group 17) on the periodic table, making it a theoretical cousin to elements like fluorine and iodine, though its properties are expected to differ significantly due to its extreme atomic weight and instability. Tennessine was officially discovered in 2010 through a collaborative effort between the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, and American institutions including Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Vanderbilt University. It was synthesized by bombarding berkelium-249 with calcium-48 nuclei, producing a few atoms that lasted only fractions of a second before decaying. The element was confirmed and recognized by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2016, and it was named in honor of the U.S. state of Tennessee, acknowledging the region’s key contributions to nuclear science. Tennessine currently has no known practical uses due to its extremely short half-life and the difficulty in producing it—only a handful of atoms have ever been made. However, its creation contributes valuable insights into nuclear physics, especially theories surrounding the island of stability, where scientists predict that certain superheavy elements might have relatively longer lifespans. As with other synthetic elements, tennessine helps researchers understand the behavior of atoms at the limits of the periodic table and deepens our knowledge of atomic structure and nuclear forces.
