        <h1>Calcium (Ca)</h1>

        <p>Calcium is a silvery-white, moderately hard alkaline earth metal with the chemical symbol Ca and atomic number 20, and it plays a critical role in both the structure of the Earth and the health of living organisms. Though calcium compounds like lime (calcium oxide) and chalk (calcium carbonate) have been used since ancient times in building materials and agriculture, elemental calcium was first isolated in 1808 by English chemist Sir Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of a mixture of lime and mercuric oxide. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the Earth’s crust and is rarely found in its pure metallic form due to its high reactivity—it readily reacts with water and oxygen to form compounds. In its compound forms, however, calcium is everywhere: it makes up limestone, marble, and gypsum, and plays a vital part in the carbon cycle through the weathering of rocks and the formation of sedimentary layers. Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) is the main ingredient in shells of marine organisms, eggshells, and pearls, while calcium phosphate is a major component of bones and teeth in animals, including humans. Biologically, calcium is indispensable. It is the most abundant mineral in the human body, making up about 1–2% of body weight, mostly in the skeleton. It not only provides structural support but also regulates essential physiological processes such as muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and enzyme activity. The body tightly regulates calcium levels in the blood through hormones like parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcitonin, drawing calcium from bones when dietary intake is insufficient, which can lead to conditions like osteoporosis if left unchecked. Dietary calcium is found abundantly in dairy products, leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and fortified foods, and its absorption is enhanced by vitamin D. Industrially, calcium compounds are widely used in construction (as cement and plaster), water treatment (to soften hard water), agriculture (as soil conditioners), and even steelmaking, where calcium is used as a deoxidizer and to remove impurities. Pure calcium metal is also used in the production of other metals such as uranium and thorium, and in some specialized batteries. Interestingly, calcium ions play a key signaling role in cellular processes, acting like a switch to trigger muscle movement or neurotransmitter release. Despite being classified as a metal, calcium in its pure form is quite soft, easily shaped, and can even be cut with a knife, although it tarnishes quickly in air. The presence of calcium ions is also what gives fireworks an orange-red color, showcasing yet another way this versatile element appears in our lives. From forming the bones in our bodies to shaping the mountains of the Earth, calcium is truly a fundamental building block of both biology and geology.
