        Xenon, element number 54 with the symbol Xe, is a colorless, odorless, and generally non-reactive noble gas found in trace amounts in the Earth's atmosphere. 1  It was discovered in 1898 by Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers while studying the components of liquefied air; its name comes from the Greek word "xenos," meaning "stranger" or "foreigner," reflecting its rarity. 1  For a long time, xenon was considered completely inert, but in 1962, Neil Bartlett synthesized the first xenon compound, xenon hexafluoroplatinate, proving that it could indeed participate in chemical reactions under certain conditions, leading to the discovery of other xenon compounds, mostly with highly electronegative elements like fluorine and oxygen. 2  Despite its relatively low reactivity, xenon has several important applications. 3  Its inertness and high atomic weight make it useful as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft, allowing for efficient long-duration missions. 4  Xenon flash lamps produce intense, short bursts of light and are used in photography, stroboscopes, and medical lasers. 5  In lighting, xenon is used in high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights in automobiles, providing bright, white light. 6  Its anesthetic properties have led to its use as a general anesthetic in some medical procedures. 1  Furthermore, xenon isotopes are used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to study porous materials and biological tissues, and xenon-133 is used as a radioactive tracer in medical imaging, particularly for lung ventilation studies. 7  While its atmospheric abundance is very low, xenon's unique properties make it valuable in specialized technological and medical fields.
