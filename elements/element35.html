        <p>Bromine is a dark reddish-brown liquid element with the atomic number 35 and the chemical symbol Br, making it one of only two elements that are liquids at room temperature—the other being mercury. It was discovered in 1826 by French chemist Antoine Jérôme Balard while he was studying salt marshes and extracted the element from brine through chemical treatment, and its name comes from the Greek word *bromos*, meaning "stench," due to its strong, unpleasant odor. Bromine belongs to the halogen group (Group 17) in the periodic table, alongside fluorine, chlorine, iodine, and astatine, and shares many of the chemical properties typical of halogens, such as high reactivity and the ability to form salts when combined with metals. In nature, bromine does not occur in elemental form due to its reactivity; instead, it is found in the form of soluble bromide salts in seawater, underground brines, and salt lakes. The largest producers of bromine today are the United States, Israel, and China, where extraction usually involves pumping brine from underground sources and then chemically oxidizing the bromide ions to free elemental bromine. Bromine and its compounds have been used in a wide variety of industrial and commercial applications, including flame retardants (especially polybrominated diphenyl ethers), water purification agents, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and certain types of photographic chemicals. In the past, bromine was used in leaded gasoline as ethylene dibromide to prevent engine knocking, though this use has been phased out due to environmental and health concerns. Organobromine compounds are also used in agriculture as fumigants and pesticides, although many of these are now restricted or banned because of their toxicity and persistence in the environment. While bromine has valuable applications, it must be handled with caution: it is highly corrosive to human tissue, can cause severe burns on contact with skin, and its vapors are irritating and toxic when inhaled. Despite its dangers, bromine remains an important element in modern chemistry and industry, with ongoing research into more sustainable and safer ways to utilize its unique chemical properties.</p>
