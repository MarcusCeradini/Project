        <p>Zinc (Zn), with atomic number 30, is a bluish-white, brittle metal that plays a vital role in various industrial, biological, and environmental processes. It has been used by humans for thousands of years, with evidence of its use in ancient India and China, where it was primarily alloyed with copper to create brass. Zinc is widely used in galvanization, a process in which zinc is coated onto iron and steel to protect them from rust and corrosion, significantly extending the lifespan of infrastructure, automobiles, and machinery exposed to harsh weather conditions. It is also an essential component in the production of batteries, particularly zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries, as well as zinc-air batteries used in hearing aids and other medical devices. Zinc is used in the manufacture of alloys like brass, bronze, and zinc-aluminum alloys, which are highly valued for their durability, strength, and resistance to corrosion. In addition to its industrial applications, zinc is crucial in biological systems; it is an essential trace element in humans, playing a key role in immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, and DNA synthesis. Zinc is a cofactor for over 300 enzymes involved in various physiological functions, and its deficiency can lead to stunted growth, weakened immunity, and cognitive impairments. Zinc also contributes to the production of rubber and paints, where zinc oxide serves as a catalyst and a protective agent. However, excessive exposure to zinc can lead to toxicity, causing nausea, vomiting, and long-term health problems. Zinc's widespread industrial use, essential biological role, and ability to prevent corrosion make it one of the most important and versatile metals in the modern world.
