        <p>Boron is a chemical element with the symbol **B** and atomic number **5**. It is a metalloid, meaning it has properties of both metals and nonmetals. Boron is found in nature primarily in the form of borates, such as borax, and is a relatively rare element in Earth's crust. It has a variety of important uses, particularly in industry. Boron compounds are essential in glass manufacturing, especially in the production of borosilicate glass, which is resistant to thermal shock and commonly used for laboratory glassware and cookware. Boron is also used in the production of fiberglass, which is a key material for insulation and composites. Additionally, it plays a role in agriculture as a micronutrient in fertilizers to help plants grow. Boron is also used in the nuclear industry, where its ability to absorb neutrons makes it useful as a neutron absorber in nuclear reactors. In addition, boron compounds are used in detergents, flame retardants, and as additives in steel production. Though boron itself is not highly toxic, some of its compounds can be harmful. Its discovery dates back to the 1800s, and it remains an essential element in various industrial and scientific applications.
