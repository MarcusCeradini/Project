        Hassium (Hs, atomic number 108) is a synthetic, superheavy element named after the German state of **Hesse**, where the **GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research** is located. It was first synthesized in **1984** by scientists at GSI by bombarding **bismuth-209** with **iron-58** ions, producing a few atoms of hassium. The discovery was confirmed in subsequent experiments, and in **1992**, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially named the element. Hassium is part of **Group 8** on the periodic table, along with **iron**, **ruthenium**, and **osmium**, and is expected to exhibit properties similar to these elements, though its chemical behavior is not well understood due to its instability. Like other superheavy elements, hassium has an extremely short half-life—measured in milliseconds—which limits its study and makes it impractical for use. While it has no known applications, its creation is important for advancing the understanding of atomic structure, nuclear forces, and the exploration of the **"island of stability,"** where scientists hope to discover more stable superheavy elements.
