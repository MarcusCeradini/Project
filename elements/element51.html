        Antimony, element number 51 with the symbol Sb, is a lustrous, silvery-gray metalloid that is brittle and flaky, possessing properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals. 1  Known since ancient times, it was mentioned in the Old Testament and was likely used in cosmetics in ancient Egypt; its symbol Sb comes from the Latin word "stibium," which was used to refer to antimony sulfide, a common ore. 2  While not abundant, antimony is found in minerals like stibnite (Sb₂S₃) and valentinite (Sb₂O₃), and it is often obtained as a byproduct of mining other metals such as lead, silver, and gold. 3  Antimony and its alloys have a variety of applications. 4  It is used to harden lead, notably in car batteries and bullets, and in solder to improve its strength and corrosion resistance. 5  Antimony compounds are crucial in flame retardants for textiles, plastics, and paints. 6  Antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃) is a widely used flame retardant, often in conjunction with halogenated compounds. 7  It also finds use in the production of certain types of glass and ceramics, as a pigment in paints, and in some semiconductors, such as indium antimonide, used in infrared detectors. 8  Historically, antimony compounds were used in traditional medicines, but due to their toxicity, these applications have largely been discontinued. Despite its toxicity in higher concentrations, antimony remains an important element in various industrial applications due to its unique properties in alloys and as a flame retardant. 9
