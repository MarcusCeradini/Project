        Berkelium (Bk, atomic number 97) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after **Berkeley, California**, where it was first discovered in **1949** by scientists Glenn T. Seaborg, Stanley Thompson, and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley. It was created by bombarding **americium-241** with **alpha particles (helium nuclei)** in a cyclotron. Berkelium is part of the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. It shares chemical properties with other actinides such as **curium** and **californium**. Because of its radioactivity and the difficulty of producing it in significant amounts, berkelium has no widespread practical applications. However, it plays a key role in scientific research, particularly in the synthesis of heavier elements. For example, **californium** and even superheavy elements like **tennessine** have been produced using berkelium targets. Its most stable isotope, **berkelium-247**, has a half-life of about 1,380 years. While it is not used commercially, berkeliumâ€™s existence and study are important for advancing nuclear chemistry and exploring the boundaries of the periodic table.
