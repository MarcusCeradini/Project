        <h1>Helium (He)</h1>
        <p>Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, and lighter-than-air gas, symbolized as He on the periodic table, with an atomic number of 2. It is the second most abundant element in the universe, primarily produced through nuclear fusion in stars, especially in the cores of massive stars. Helium was first discovered in the Sun's spectrum in 1868 by the British astronomer Sir William Ramsay, who later confirmed its presence on Earth in 1895. Unlike nitrogen or oxygen, helium is non-reactive, which makes it highly stable and perfect for uses where chemical reactivity must be avoided. On Earth, it is primarily sourced from natural gas deposits, where it accumulates over millions of years as a result of the decay of radioactive elements. Helium’s most well-known use is as a lifting gas in balloons and airships due to its low density and non-flammable properties—making it a safer alternative to hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Besides that, helium plays a critical role in cryogenics, especially in cooling superconducting magnets used in medical MRI machines and particle accelerators. It’s also used in controlled atmospheres for welding, in breathing mixtures for deep-sea diving to prevent nitrogen narcosis, and in the aerospace industry to pressurize fuel tanks. Helium is unique in that it remains in a gaseous state even at extremely low temperatures and cannot be solidified under normal pressure, making it a fascinating subject in physical chemistry. Despite being abundant in the universe, on Earth it is a rare and non-renewable resource, which has led to increasing concerns about its depletion.
