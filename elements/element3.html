        <p>Lithium is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal with the atomic number 3, discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfvedson. It is the lightest metal and an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Lithium's most significant uses today are in rechargeable batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, which power devices like smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. Additionally, lithium salts, especially lithium carbonate, are used to treat bipolar disorder. It also plays a role in producing heat-resistant glass, lubricants, and in the aluminum industry. Though relatively rare, lithium is found in minerals like spodumene and is also extracted from seawater. As the demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy storage grows, lithium's importance continues to rise, leading to increased global interest in its supply and extraction, particularly in the Lithium Triangle of South America.
