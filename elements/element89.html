        Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, and highly radioactive metal with the chemical symbol Ac and atomic number 89, marking the beginning of the actinide series in the periodic table. It was discovered in 1899 by French chemist André-Louis Debierne while researching rare earth elements, and independently by Friedrich Oskar Giesel in 1902. The name “actinium” comes from the Greek word aktinos, meaning "ray" or "beam," in reference to the strong radioactivity it emits. Actinium occurs in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores, but due to its scarcity in nature, it is usually produced artificially in nuclear reactors by irradiating radium or thorium. The most common isotope, actinium-227, has a half-life of about 21.8 years and emits both alpha and beta radiation. Actinium glows faintly in the dark due to its intense radioactivity, which excites surrounding air molecules. Its primary use is as a neutron source in scientific and medical applications, particularly in cancer treatment research through targeted alpha therapy (TAT). Although actinium has limited commercial use because of its rarity and radioactivity, it plays an important role in nuclear science and radiopharmaceutical development. Like other heavy radioactive elements, handling actinium requires strict safety protocols to prevent contamination and exposure.
