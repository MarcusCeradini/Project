        <p>Germanium (Ge), with atomic number 32, is a lustrous, grayish-white metalloid that occupies a unique place in the periodic table due to its properties that are intermediate between metals and nonmetals. Discovered in 1886 by German chemist Clemens Winkler, who named it after his homeland, Germany, germanium was predicted years earlier by Dmitri Mendeleev as "eka-silicon" because of its expected similarity to silicon. Though relatively rare in Earthâ€™s crust, germanium is typically obtained as a byproduct of zinc, copper, and lead ore processing. Its most significant use is in the field of electronics and semiconductors, where germanium was one of the first materials used to develop early transistors before being largely replaced by silicon due to cost and abundance. However, germanium still plays a vital role in fiber optics, infrared optics, and solar cell technology, especially in high-efficiency space solar panels, where it serves as a substrate in multi-junction photovoltaic cells. Germanium is transparent to infrared radiation, which makes it essential for thermal imaging devices, night-vision goggles, and high-precision optical instruments used in military and scientific applications.
