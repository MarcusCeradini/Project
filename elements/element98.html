        Californium (Cf, atomic number 98) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after the state of **California** and the **University of California**, where it was first synthesized in **1950** by scientists Stanley Thompson, Glenn Seaborg, Kenneth Street Jr., and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley. It was created by bombarding **curium-242** with **alpha particles (helium nuclei)** in a particle accelerator. Californium is part of the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. One of its most notable isotopes, californium-252, is a strong **neutron emitter**, making it highly useful in certain industrial and scientific applications. It is used in **neutron radiography**, **oil well logging**, and as a **neutron source** in nuclear reactors and for starting other reactors. Californium can also be used to help detect gold and silver ores and to treat certain types of cancer. Despite its usefulness, it is extremely radioactive and expensive to produce, so it is only made in small amounts in specialized facilities. Its creation and study have significantly advanced the understanding of heavy elements and their behavior in nuclear reactions.
