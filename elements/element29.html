        <p>Copper (Cu), with atomic number 29, is a reddish-brown, malleable, and ductile metal that has been used by humans for over 10,000 years, dating back to the Bronze Age when it was alloyed with tin to create bronze. The name "copper" comes from the Latin cuprum, meaning "from Cyprus," where much of the ancient copper was mined. Copper is highly valued for its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, making it essential for electrical wiring, electronic components, and heat exchangers—its conductivity is second only to silver, but it is far more affordable and abundant. Beyond electrical uses, copper is also widely used in plumbing, roofing, coins, and jewelry due to its corrosion resistance, malleability, and aesthetic appeal. When alloyed with other metals, copper forms brass (copper and zinc) and bronze (copper and tin), both known for their durability, hardness, and resistance to corrosion, making them invaluable in construction, machinery, and weaponry. Biologically, copper is an essential trace element in the human body, playing a role in the formation of hemoglobin, collagen, and other vital compounds. It is involved in the functioning of enzymes that support energy production, brain function, and the immune system. However, while copper is vital, excessive levels can lead to toxicity, causing conditions like Wilson's disease, a genetic disorder leading to the accumulation of copper in organs. Copper’s antimicrobial properties are another remarkable feature, with copper surfaces shown to kill bacteria, viruses, and fungi on contact, making it valuable in healthcare settings for reducing the spread of infections. Over time, copper develops a distinctive green patina due to oxidation, which has become iconic in structures like the Statue of Liberty and various ancient buildings. From electrical wiring and plumbing to medical applications and ancient monuments, copper’s versatility, durability, and biological importance have made it one of the most significant and widely used metals in human history.
