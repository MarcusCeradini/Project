        <p>Neon, with the symbol **Ne** and atomic number **10**, is a noble gas known for its bright reddish-orange glow when electrically charged in a vacuum tube. It is colorless, odorless, and inert under most conditions, meaning it doesn’t easily react with other elements. Neon is the fifth most abundant element in the universe, though it is relatively rare on Earth, typically extracted from the atmosphere through fractional distillation of liquid air. Its most well-known use is in **neon signs**, where its vivid glow is used for advertising and decorative lighting. Beyond signage, neon is also used in high-voltage indicators, vacuum tubes, television tubes, and some types of lasers. Neon was discovered in 1898 by British scientists Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers, shortly after they discovered krypton and xenon. Its name comes from the Greek word *neos*, meaning “new.” Although it has few chemical applications due to its inert nature, neon remains iconic for its role in lighting and visual culture.
