        Terbium, element number 65 with the symbol Tb, is a silvery-white rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. It was discovered in 1843 by Carl Gustaf Mosander, who named it after the village of Ytterby in Sweden, the same source for the names of yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium. Terbium is found in minerals such as monazite and xenotime and is obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. It is relatively soft and malleable and oxidizes readily in air, requiring storage under oil or in an inert atmosphere. While not as abundant as some other lanthanides, terbium plays a crucial role in several high-technology applications. Its primary use is as a phosphor activator in green fluorescent lighting, particularly in energy-saving fluorescent light bulbs and cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, where it contributes to the brilliant green color. Terbium compounds are also used in some full-color displays and as dopants in laser materials. Furthermore, terbium is an important component in certain high-performance permanent magnets, particularly those used in specialized applications requiring stability at high temperatures, often in conjunction with neodymium and dysprosium. Its magnetic properties are also explored for potential use in magneto-optical storage devices. Although its overall demand is lower than some other rare earth elements, terbium's unique luminescent and magnetic characteristics make it essential in specific lighting, display, and magnetic technologies.
