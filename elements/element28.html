        <p>Nickel (Ni), with atomic number 28, is a hard, silvery-white metal known for its strength, corrosion resistance, and ability to form alloys with other metals. Isolated in 1751 by Swedish chemist Axel Fredrik Cronstedt, who named it after the German word kupfernickel meaning "false copper," nickel is primarily found in ores like pentlandite, garnierite, and nickeliferous laterites. It plays a crucial role in the production of stainless steel, enhancing its strength, resistance to corrosion, and overall durability, making it indispensable in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Nickel is also used in alloys like nichrome for heating elements and monel for marine applications, thanks to its resistance to seawater corrosion. Furthermore, nickel-based batteries, particularly nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, are widely used in applications such as hybrid electric vehicles, consumer electronics, and power tools due to their high energy density and long cycle life. Beyond industrial uses, nickel is employed in the minting of coins, often alloyed with copper for durable, corrosion-resistant currency. Biologically, nickel is a trace element essential for some organisms, though humans require only small amounts, and excessive exposure can be toxic, leading to respiratory issues, skin allergies, and even cancer in extreme cases. Despite these health risks, nickel’s unique properties—high melting point, ability to form durable alloys, and resistance to corrosion—make it an essential metal in a broad range of applications, from energy storage and electronics to aerospace and coinage.
