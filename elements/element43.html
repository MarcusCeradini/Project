        Technetium, element number 43 with the symbol Tc, is a unique transition metal as it is the lightest element with no stable isotopes, making it radioactive. It is a silvery-gray crystalline solid that tarnishes slowly in moist air. The existence of technetium was predicted by Dmitri Mendeleev, and it was the first element to be artificially produced, synthesized in 1937 by Emilio Segr√® and Carlo Perrier by bombarding molybdenum with deuterons. While trace amounts of technetium can be found naturally in uranium ores as a product of spontaneous fission, it is primarily obtained from spent nuclear fuel. The most significant application of technetium, particularly its metastable isotope technetium-99m ($^{99m}$Tc) with a half-life of about six hours, is in nuclear medicine. $^{99m}$Tc is used in a vast number of diagnostic imaging procedures, tracing the function and structure of various organs like the brain, bones, heart, thyroid, lungs, kidneys, liver, and spleen, as well as for detecting infections and certain types of cancer, due to its favorable nuclear properties, including the emission of easily detectable gamma rays and low energy electrons, which minimizes the radiation dose to the patient. Another interesting property of technetium is its ability to act as a remarkable corrosion inhibitor for steel in closed systems, although its radioactivity limits this application. Technetium-99, with a much longer half-life of 211,000 years and beta emission, is used for calibrating scientific instruments and has potential applications in specialized nuclear batteries. Chemically, technetium resembles rhenium and can exist in various oxidation states, forming compounds with elements like oxygen, sulfur, and halogens.
