        Copernicium (Cn, atomic number 112) is a synthetic, superheavy element named in honor of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. It was first created in 1996 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The team produced copernicium by bombarding lead-208 with zinc-70 ions, resulting in a few atoms of the new element, which decayed rapidly in milliseconds. The discovery was confirmed over the next several years, and in 2010, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially named the element copernicium. It is part of Group 12 on the periodic table, alongside zinc, cadmium, and mercury, and was originally thought to behave like a heavier version of mercury. However, theoretical studies suggest it might be a gas at room temperature due to strong relativistic effects that alter its expected chemical behavior. Because of its extremely short half-life and the challenges in producing it, copernicium has no known practical applications. Its primary value lies in advancing our understanding of superheavy elements, nuclear physics, and the limits of the periodic table.
