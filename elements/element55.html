        Cesium, element number 55 with the symbol Cs, is a soft, silvery-gold alkali metal that is liquid at or slightly above room temperature, making it one of only a few elemental metals that are liquid near standard conditions. It was the first element discovered using spectroscopy, identified in 1860 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff in mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany; its name comes from the Latin word "caesius," meaning "sky-blue," referring to the bright blue lines in its emission spectrum. Cesium is extremely reactive, readily igniting spontaneously in air and reacting explosively with water, even ice at temperatures above -116 °C, necessitating careful handling and storage under inert atmospheres or vacuum. Due to its low ionization energy, cesium readily loses its outermost electron, making it highly photoelectric, a property utilized in photocells and photomultiplier tubes for detecting infrared light. Its high atomic mass and large ionic radius also make cesium compounds useful in drilling fluids for the oil industry. The isotope cesium-133 is the basis for the definition of the second in the International System of Units (SI), where one second is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of the microwave radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom, 1  highlighting its fundamental role in precise timekeeping through atomic clocks. Other radioactive isotopes of cesium, such as cesium-137, are used in medical radiation therapy and industrial gauging devices. While relatively rare, primarily obtained as a byproduct of lithium production from minerals like pollucite, cesium's unique physical and chemical properties make it essential in specialized applications ranging from atomic clocks to photoelectric devices and certain industrial processes.
