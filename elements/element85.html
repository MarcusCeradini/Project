        Astatine is a rare and highly radioactive halogen with the chemical symbol At and atomic number 85, located in Group 17 of the periodic table beneath iodine. It is the rarest naturally occurring element on Earth, with only trace amounts found in nature as a result of the decay of heavier elements like uranium and thorium. Astatine was first synthesized in 1940 by Dale R. Corson, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Emilio Segr√® at the University of California, Berkeley, by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles. Its name comes from the Greek word astatos, meaning "unstable," which reflects its extremely short half-lives and radioactive nature. The most stable isotope, astatine-210, has a half-life of just 8.1 hours, making it nearly impossible to accumulate or study in significant quantities. Chemically, astatine is expected to behave like a heavier version of iodine, though many of its properties remain theoretical due to its rarity and instability. Astatine has no significant industrial uses, but it holds potential in the medical field, particularly in targeted alpha-particle cancer therapy (TAT), where its radioactive emissions can help destroy cancer cells with precision. However, its scarcity and high radioactivity present major challenges in research and application. As one of the least understood elements, astatine remains a subject of scientific curiosity and limited experimental study.
