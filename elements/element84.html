        Polonium is a highly radioactive metal with the chemical symbol Po and atomic number 84, located in the chalcogen group (Group 16) of the periodic table. It was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie while they were studying the radioactive properties of uranium ores. They named the element after Poland, Marie Curie's homeland, to bring attention to the country's plight at the time. Polonium occurs in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores as a decay product of radon, and can also be artificially synthesized in nuclear reactors. The most stable isotope of polonium, polonium-210, has a half-life of 138 days and emits alpha particles, making it highly toxic when ingested or inhaled, though it is less dangerous externally due to its inability to penetrate the skin. Polonium has been used in a variety of applications, including as a heat source in space satellites and in anti-static devices, but its most notorious use has been in the assassination of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in 2006, where polonium-210 was used as a poison. Due to its radioactivity and toxicity, polonium is extremely difficult to handle and requires strict safety protocols. It has no widespread industrial or medical applications, aside from research in radiochemistry, and remains an element of significant interest due to its extreme radiotoxicity.
