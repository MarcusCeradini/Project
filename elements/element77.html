        Iridium, element number 77 with the symbol Ir, is a remarkably dense, hard, and brittle silvery-white transition metal belonging to the platinum group. Discovered in 1803 by Smithson Tennant in the black residue left after dissolving crude platinum in aqua regia, its name originates from the Greek word "iris," meaning "rainbow," due to the vibrant colors of its salts. Iridium stands out as the most corrosion-resistant metal known, unreactive to most acids, including aqua regia, and maintaining excellent mechanical properties even at high temperatures. This exceptional resistance and high melting point contribute to its key applications, primarily as a hardening agent in platinum alloys used for durable jewelry, surgical pins, and electrical contacts, including those in high-performance spark plugs, especially in the aviation industry. An alloy with osmium is used for the tips of fountain pens and compass bearings. Iridium is also crucial in the creation of crucibles and other high-temperature equipment for scientific and industrial use. Furthermore, its catalytic properties are valuable in various chemical processes. Interestingly, a distinct layer of iridium found globally in sediments dating to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary provides evidence supporting the theory that a large asteroid impact contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs, as meteorites have a significantly higher iridium concentration than the Earth's crust. While rare, with most production occurring as a byproduct of nickel and platinum mining in countries like South Africa, Russia, and Canada, iridium's unique combination of properties makes it indispensable in several high-tech and specialized applications, including some medical treatments like brachytherapy using radioactive isotopes.
