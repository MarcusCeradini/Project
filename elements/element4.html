        <p>Beryllium is a strong, lightweight, and brittle alkaline earth metal with the atomic number 4 and the symbol Be. It was first discovered in 1798 by French chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin. Beryllium has high thermal conductivity and is non-magnetic, making it useful in various specialized applications. It is most commonly used in the aerospace industry, where its lightweight and strength properties are crucial for components in aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles. Beryllium is also used in nuclear reactors as a neutron reflector and in the production of X-ray windows due to its transparency to X-rays. The metal is also found in alloys, such as beryllium copper, which is highly conductive and corrosion-resistant, used in electrical connectors and springs. However, beryllium is toxic when inhaled as dust or fumes, which makes handling it carefully essential. Though rare in nature, beryllium is found in minerals like beryl and bertrandite. Its discovery and use date back to the early 19th century, and it continues to be vital in high-tech industries despite its toxicity concerns.
