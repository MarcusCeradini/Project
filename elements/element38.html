        Strontium, element number 38 with the symbol Sr, is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is highly chemically reactive and thus never found in its pure form in nature. 1  Discovered as a new element in 1790 by Adair Crawford and later isolated in 1808 by Humphry Davy, its name originates from the Scottish village of Strontian where the mineral strontianite (strontium carbonate) was first found. 2  Strontium shares similar chemical properties with calcium and barium, readily reacting with air to form an oxide layer and with water to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. 3  A prominent application of strontium compounds is in pyrotechnics, where strontium salts like strontium nitrate and strontium chloride impart a brilliant crimson red color to fireworks and flares. 4  Strontium carbonate is used in the manufacturing of certain types of glass, particularly for color television picture tubes to absorb X-rays, and in the production of ferrite magnets used in loudspeakers and electric motors. 5  In medicine, strontium ranelate has been used to treat osteoporosis in some parts of the world, and radioactive isotopes like strontium-89 are employed in cancer therapy to alleviate bone pain. 6  While stable strontium is not considered biologically essential, its radioactive isotope strontium-90, a byproduct of nuclear fission, is dangerous due to its chemical similarity to calcium, leading to its incorporation into bones. 7  Naturally occurring strontium is primarily obtained from the minerals celestine (strontium sulfate) and strontianite, highlighting its importance in various industrial, technological, and medical fields due to its unique chemical and physical characteristics. 8  Â
