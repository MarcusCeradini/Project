        Promethium, element number 61 with the symbol Pm, is a radioactive rare earth metal and the only lanthanide not found naturally on Earth in substantial amounts, with only trace quantities occurring as a product of uranium decay; it was first definitively produced and identified in 1945 by Jacob A. 1  Marinsky, Lawrence E. Glendenin, and Charles D. Coryell while examining uranium fission byproducts during World War II, and it was named after Prometheus, the Titan who gave fire to humanity, symbolizing its artificial creation through nuclear processes. 2  All isotopes of promethium are radioactive, with promethium-147 being the most readily available and having a half-life of about 2.6 years; this isotope emits beta particles and is utilized in various niche applications, including as a beta radiation source for thickness gauges, in specialized atomic batteries for devices like pacemakers and remote sensors by converting beta decay into electricity using semiconductors, and in luminous paints for safety signs and instrument panels by exciting phosphors to emit light. 3  While largely used for research due to its radioactivity and scarcity, promethium's chemical behavior is typical of other trivalent lanthanides, forming pink or red colored compounds, and ongoing research continues to explore its potential in areas like medical diagnostics and targeted cancer therapies using its radioactive isotopes. 4  Â
