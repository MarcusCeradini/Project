        Francium is an extremely rare and highly radioactive alkali metal with the chemical symbol Fr and atomic number 87, located at the bottom of Group 1 on the periodic table. It was discovered in 1939 by French physicist Marguerite Perey at the Curie Institute in Paris, and was named in honor of France. Francium occurs naturally in minute amounts as a decay product of actinium, but because of its incredibly short half-life—francium-223, the most stable isotope, lasts only about 22 minutes—it cannot be collected in any usable quantity. As a result, most of what is known about francium comes from theoretical predictions and brief laboratory experiments using synthesized atoms. It is believed to be a soft, metallic element similar to cesium, and would likely be the most reactive of all the alkali metals, though its properties are difficult to study due to its scarcity and rapid decay. Francium has no commercial applications due to its rarity, short lifespan, and intense radioactivity, but it is occasionally used in atomic research to study the behavior of heavy atoms and nuclear structure. Because it is so rare—scientists estimate there are less than 30 grams of francium in the Earth's crust at any given time—it remains one of the least understood naturally occurring elements.
