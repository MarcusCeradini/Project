        Nihonium (Nh, atomic number 113) is a synthetic, superheavy element that was first created in 2004 by scientists at the RIKEN institute in Japan by bombarding bismuth-209 with zinc-70 ions. The experiment produced only a few atoms of nihonium, each lasting for less than a second before decaying. Later, its discovery was confirmed by additional experiments, and in 2016, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially recognized the element and approved the name nihonium, derived from "Nihon," one of the Japanese words for Japan, making it the first element named after a country in East Asia. Nihonium is located in Group 13 of the periodic table, along with elements like boron, aluminum, and thallium, though its chemical and physical properties remain largely unknown due to its short half-life and the difficulty of producing it. It is expected to behave like a heavy metal and possibly show some unique traits due to relativistic effects. Nihonium has no current practical applications, but its creation is significant in the study of superheavy elements, offering insights into the forces that hold atomic nuclei together and contributing to the ongoing search for more stable elements in the "island of stability."
