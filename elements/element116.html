        Livermorium (Lv, atomic number 116) is a synthetic, superheavy element named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which collaborated in its discovery. It was first synthesized in 2000 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Russia and LLNL in the U.S. by bombarding curium-248 with calcium-48 ions, producing just a few atoms that quickly decayed. The element was officially recognized and named by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 2012. Livermorium is part of Group 16 in the periodic table (the oxygen group), but due to its extreme instability and high atomic number, its chemical properties are not well known and may differ from lighter elements in its group. It has no practical uses because of its very short half-life—lasting only milliseconds—and the difficulty and cost of producing it. However, livermorium plays an important role in scientific research, helping physicists study the limits of the periodic table and the possibility of more stable superheavy elements in the theorized "island of stability."
