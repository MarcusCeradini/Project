        <p>Arsenic (As), with atomic number 33, is a naturally occurring metalloid known for its notorious toxicity as well as its historical and modern uses in a range of industries and technologies. It exists in several allotropic forms, most commonly as a brittle, gray metallic-looking solid, and occurs in minerals such as arsenopyrite, often in combination with sulfur and metals. Arsenic has a long and infamous history, particularly in the form of arsenic trioxide, which was once known as the “king of poisons” due to its odorless, tasteless, and deadly properties—often used in historical crimes and political assassinations. However, arsenic's role isn't limited to its toxicity. In the modern world, it plays important roles in semiconductor technology, where gallium arsenide (GaAs) is used in integrated circuits, solar cells, lasers, and LEDs due to its ability to efficiently convert electricity into light and vice versa. Arsenic is also used in the production of alloys, particularly in strengthening lead-based materials such as those used in car batteries and ammunition.

            Agriculturally, arsenic compounds were historically used in pesticides, herbicides, and wood preservatives (such as chromated copper arsenate, or CCA), although many of these uses have been restricted or banned in many countries due to environmental and health concerns. Despite its toxicity, arsenic is also used in medicine, especially in the treatment of certain cancers; for example, arsenic trioxide is used as a chemotherapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a rare type of blood cancer. In small trace amounts, arsenic may have a biological role in some animals, although it is not considered essential for humans, and chronic exposure to arsenic—often through contaminated water or food—can lead to severe health effects such as skin lesions, organ damage, and an increased risk of cancer. The element's dual nature as both a deadly poison and a useful industrial and medicinal material makes arsenic one of the most complex and paradoxical elements in the periodic table.
