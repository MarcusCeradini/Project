        Tantalum, element number 73 with the symbol Ta, is a rare, hard, blue-gray, lustrous transition metal that is highly corrosion-resistant. 1  It was discovered in 1802 by Anders Gustaf Ekeberg and named after the mythological Greek figure Tantalus, who was punished by the gods and made to stand in water under fruit trees, unable to reach either, alluding to the difficulty Ekeberg had in dissolving the metal in acids. 2  Tantalum is often found in the minerals tantalite and columbite (which also contains niobium), and its extraction is a complex process. 3  One of its key properties is its excellent biocompatibility, making it widely used in surgical implants, such as artificial joints, bone screws, and dental implants, as the body readily accepts it. 4  Tantalum also has a high melting point and good electrical conductivity, leading to its use in high-temperature applications, such as jet engine components, and in the production of high-performance capacitors, which are essential components in electronic devices like smartphones, laptops, and automotive electronics due to their ability to store electrical energy efficiently in a small volume. 5  Furthermore, tantalum is used in vacuum furnace parts, chemical processing equipment due to its corrosion resistance, and in certain alloys to enhance strength and ductility. 6  While relatively scarce, primarily mined in countries like Australia, Brazil, and some parts of Africa, tantalum's unique combination of biocompatibility, electrical properties, and resistance to extreme conditions makes it a critical material in various advanced technologies and medical applications.
