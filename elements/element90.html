        Thorium is a naturally occurring, slightly radioactive metal with the chemical symbol Th and atomic number 90, positioned in the actinide series of the periodic table. It was discovered in 1828 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Thorium is silvery-white and tarnishes when exposed to air, forming a black oxide layer. It is more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium and can be found in minerals such as monazite and thorite. Unlike uranium, most naturally occurring thorium is found as a single isotope, thorium-232, which is fertile rather than fissile—meaning it cannot sustain a nuclear chain reaction by itself but can be converted into the fissile isotope uranium-233 in a reactor. This has led to interest in thorium as a potential fuel for nuclear power, especially in molten salt reactors, due to its relative abundance, lower long-term radioactive waste, and enhanced safety profile compared to uranium-based fuels. Historically, thorium was used in gas mantles for portable lamps because it glowed brightly when heated, although this use has declined due to safety concerns. It has also been used in alloys, optics, and even in some consumer products in the past, though modern uses are limited due to its radioactivity. Despite its promise, thorium-based nuclear energy technology remains largely experimental, with research and development ongoing in countries like India, which has large thorium reserves. Like other radioactive elements, thorium requires careful handling, but its potential for cleaner, safer nuclear energy continues to generate scientific and industrial interest.
