        <p>Fluorine, with the symbol **F** and atomic number **9**, is a pale yellow, highly toxic, and extremely reactive gas at room temperature. It is the most electronegative and reactive of all elements, which means it readily forms compounds with almost all other elements, including some noble gases. Fluorine is rarely found in its pure form in nature due to its high reactivity, but it occurs in minerals such as fluorite (calcium fluoride). Its compounds are widely used: fluoride is added to toothpaste and drinking water to help prevent tooth decay; hydrofluoric acid is used in glass etching and metal processing; and various fluorinated compounds are essential in the manufacture of non-stick coatings like Teflon, refrigerants, and pharmaceuticals. Fluorine was first isolated in 1886 by French chemist Henri Moissan after many unsuccessful and dangerous attempts by othersâ€”its high reactivity made it notoriously difficult to handle. Today, fluorine continues to be a vital element in both industrial chemistry and healthcare, despite its hazardous nature.
