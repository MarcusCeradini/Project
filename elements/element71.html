        Lutetium, element number 71 with the symbol Lu, is a silvery-white, hard, and dense rare earth metal, notable for being the heaviest and hardest among the lanthanides and possessing the highest melting point within this series at 1663 Â°C. It was independently discovered in 1907 by three scientists: Georges Urbain, Carl Auer von Welsbach, and Charles James, with Urbain being officially credited and naming it after "Lutetia," the Latin name for Paris. Lutetium is found in trace amounts in minerals like monazite and bastnasite and is challenging and costly to extract, making it one of the more expensive rare earth elements. While it has limited commercial applications due to its scarcity, lutetium acts as a catalyst in petroleum refining for cracking hydrocarbons, in hydrogenation, alkylation, and polymerization processes, and its compounds are used in phosphors for LED lighting and as hosts for scintillators in X-ray detectors and PET scanners. Notably, the radioactive isotope lutetium-177 is increasingly important in targeted radionuclide therapy for certain cancers, such as neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer, showcasing a significant medical application for this otherwise relatively obscure element.    </p>
