        Iodine, element number 53 with the symbol I, is a dark-purple to black nonmetallic solid at room temperature that sublimes readily into a violet gas with a pungent odor. 1  It was discovered in 1811 by the French chemist Bernard Courtois while working with seaweed ash, and its name comes from the Greek word "iodes," meaning "violet-colored," referring to the vapor it produces. 2  Iodine is the heaviest of the stable halogens and is relatively unreactive compared to fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. 3  It is an essential trace element for most living organisms, playing a crucial role in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, which regulate metabolism; iodine deficiency is a major global health issue, leading to conditions like goiter and developmental problems. 4  To combat this, iodine compounds, most notably potassium iodide, are often added to table salt, a process called iodization. 5  Iodine has various other applications, including as an antiseptic and disinfectant in tincture of iodine and iodophors used to clean wounds and sterilize equipment. 6  Silver iodide is used in cloud seeding to induce rain. 7  Iodine is also vital in organic chemistry for the synthesis of various compounds and as a catalyst. 8  In photography, iodine compounds were historically used in the daguerreotype process. 9  Radioactive isotopes of iodine, such as iodine-131, are used in medical treatments for thyroid disorders and as tracers in medical imaging. 10  Despite its potential toxicity in elemental form, iodine and its compounds are essential in biology, medicine, and various industrial processes. 11  Â
