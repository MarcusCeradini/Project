        Rubidium, element number 37 with the symbol Rb, is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal that is highly reactive, similar to other elements in its group. It was discovered in 1861 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff using spectroscopy, who identified it by its characteristic dark red spectral lines, hence its name derived from the Latin word "rubidus," meaning "deepest red." Rubidium is quite abundant in the Earth's crust, though it doesn't occur in high concentrations, often found as a trace element in minerals like lepidolite, pollucite, and carnallite, and is typically obtained as a byproduct of lithium extraction. Being an alkali metal, rubidium reacts vigorously with air and water, igniting spontaneously in air and reacting explosively with water to produce hydrogen gas and rubidium hydroxide, a strong base. Due to its high reactivity, it is stored under mineral oil or in an inert atmosphere. While it doesn't have as many widespread applications as some other alkali metals, rubidium has several important uses. Its compounds are used in the production of special glasses and in some photocells. Rubidium vapor is employed in atomic clocks, although cesium-based atomic clocks are more precise and commonly used as the primary time standard. Rubidium salts have been investigated for potential medical applications, including in the treatment of certain mental disorders, though these uses are not yet widespread. Additionally, rubidium is used in some ion propulsion systems for spacecraft. Its ability to be easily ionized makes it useful in certain research applications, such as in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) power generation and as a component in some types of lasers.
