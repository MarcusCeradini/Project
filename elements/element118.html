    <p>Oganesson (Og, atomic number 118) is the heaviest known element on the periodic table and one of the rarest, with only a few atoms ever produced. It was first successfully synthesized in 2002 by a team of Russian and American scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the United States. The scientists created oganesson by bombarding atoms of californium-249 with calcium-48 ions, resulting in a few atoms of this superheavy element, which decayed in less than a millisecond. The discovery was officially confirmed in 2015, and in 2016, the element was named oganesson to honor Russian nuclear physicist Yuri Oganessian, a leading researcher in the field of superheavy elements. Oganesson is placed in Group 18, the noble gases, but due to relativistic effects and its extreme mass, it is predicted to have very different chemical and physical properties compared to lighter noble gases like neon or radon. It currently has no practical applications because of its high instability and the difficulty in producing it, but it holds scientific importance in exploring the boundaries of atomic structure, nuclear stability, and the theoretical “island of stability” where more long-lived superheavy elements may exist.


        In 2015, the discovery was confirmed by IUPAC, and in 2016, it was named oganesson after physicist Yuri Oganessian. It is a noble gas, but its properties may differ due to its extreme mass and instability. Only a few atoms have ever been made.</p>
