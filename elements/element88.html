        Radium is a highly radioactive, silvery-white metal with the chemical symbol Ra and atomic number 88, located in the alkaline earth metals group of the periodic table. It was discovered in 1898 by scientists Marie and Pierre Curie while they were studying the mineral pitchblende (now called uraninite), and its name comes from the Latin word radius, meaning "ray," due to the powerful rays it emitted. Radium is found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium ores as a decay product of uranium-238. The most common isotope, radium-226, has a half-life of about 1,600 years and emits alpha particles, along with smaller amounts of beta and gamma radiation. Radium was historically famous for its intense radioactivity and was once used in self-luminous paints for watches, clocks, instrument dials, and even toys and cosmetics in the early 20th century. However, these uses were discontinued after it became clear that exposure to radium posed serious health risks, especially due to its accumulation in bones and its association with bone cancer and anemia. This became tragically well-known through the stories of the "Radium Girls," factory workers who suffered severe radiation poisoning from handling radium-laced paint. Today, radium is rarely used outside of scientific research and specialized medical applications, such as in targeted cancer treatments. Due to its intense radioactivity and toxicity, handling radium requires strict safety precautions and regulatory oversight.
