        Bohrium (Bh, atomic number 107) is a synthetic, superheavy element named in honor of the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who made groundbreaking contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum mechanics. It was first synthesized in 1981 by scientists at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The team produced bohrium by bombarding bismuth-209 with carbon-12 ions, resulting in a few atoms of bohrium that decayed almost immediately. The discovery was confirmed in subsequent experiments, and in 1994, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially named the element after Niels Bohr. Bohrium is part of Group 7 on the periodic table, along with elements like manganese, technetium, and rhenium, and is expected to share some chemical properties with these elements, although its behavior is not well understood due to its instability. Because of its extremely short half-life—measured in milliseconds—bohrium has no practical applications, and its chemical properties remain largely theoretical. Its creation, however, contributes to the ongoing research into the behavior of superheavy elements and nuclear physics, particularly in exploring the limits of the periodic table and the theorized "island of stability," where longer-lived superheavy elements may exist.
