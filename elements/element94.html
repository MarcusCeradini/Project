        Plutonium (Pu, atomic number 94) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after the dwarf planet **Pluto**, continuing the naming sequence after **uranium** and **neptunium**. It was first produced in **1940** by scientists Glenn T. Seaborg, Edwin McMillan, Joseph Kennedy, and Arthur Wahl at the **University of California, Berkeley**, by bombarding **uranium-238** with **deuterons**. Plutonium is part of the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. Its most significant isotope, **plutonium-239**, is a **fissile material** that plays a critical role in both **nuclear weapons** and **nuclear reactors** as a source of energy. Another isotope, **plutonium-238**, is used in **radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)** to power spacecraft, including the Voyager and Mars rover missions. Plutonium is highly toxic and radioactive, requiring strict handling and storage procedures. Its discovery was a major milestone in nuclear chemistry and contributed significantly to the development of atomic energy. While its applications have been both constructive and destructive, plutonium remains one of the most well-known and heavily studied radioactive elements.
