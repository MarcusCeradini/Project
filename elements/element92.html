        Uranium is a dense, silvery-gray metallic element that is slightly radioactive and found naturally in the Earth's crust. With the atomic number 92 and symbol "U," it belongs to the actinide series of the periodic table. Uranium has been known since the late 18th century, first discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named it after the newly discovered planet Uranus. However, it wasnâ€™t until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that its radioactive properties were fully understood, thanks to pioneering research by scientists like Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie. Naturally occurring uranium is composed primarily of two isotopes: uranium-238, which makes up over 99% of natural uranium, and uranium-235, which is the only fissile isotope, capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction. This property makes uranium-235 crucial for use in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Uranium is primarily used as a fuel in nuclear power plants, where controlled fission reactions produce heat that is used to generate electricity. It has also been used historically in the production of nuclear weapons, most notably during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In addition to its role in energy and defense, uranium has been used in the past for coloring glass and ceramics, and in photographic chemicals. Mining of uranium occurs in several countries including Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan, and the United States. Due to its radioactive nature and potential environmental impact, the handling and disposal of uranium and its byproducts are carefully regulated. Despite its controversial uses, uranium remains a key element in the conversation about sustainable energy, especially as the world looks for alternatives to fossil fuels.
