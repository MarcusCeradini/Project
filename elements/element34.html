        <p>Selenium is a fascinating nonmetal element with the atomic number 34 and the chemical symbol Se, discovered in 1817 by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius while he was investigating residues from sulfuric acid production and noticed a substance that behaved similarly to tellurium—another element named after the Earth—so he named the new element after the Greek word *selene*, meaning Moon. Selenium exists in several allotropic forms, including a red amorphous powder, a gray metallic crystalline form (which is the most stable and conductive), and a black glass-like form. It is found in nature in metal sulfide ores, often alongside copper, silver, or lead, and is typically recovered as a byproduct of refining these ores. Selenium is best known for its photoconductive properties, meaning its electrical conductivity increases with exposure to light, which made it one of the earliest materials used in photocells, solar cells, and early light meters in photography during the 19th and early 20th centuries. In modern times, its semiconductor characteristics are still exploited in electronics, though its use has diminished with the rise of silicon and other advanced materials. Selenium is also used extensively in the glass industry to decolorize glass and to make red-colored glasses and enamels. It plays a vital role in metallurgy as an additive to stainless steel and other alloys, improving machinability and resistance to oxidation. In small amounts, selenium is essential to human and animal health—it forms part of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps protect cells from oxidative damage—but it is toxic in larger quantities, and chronic exposure can lead to a condition known as selenosis, with symptoms like hair loss, fatigue, and neurological damage. Selenium is also used in agriculture as a supplement in animal feed and fertilizers to prevent deficiencies in livestock and crops grown in selenium-poor soils. Additionally, selenium compounds have been investigated for potential roles in cancer prevention and other health benefits, though these uses are still under study and not without controversy.
