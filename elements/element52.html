        Tellurium, element number 52 with the symbol Te, is a brittle, mildly toxic, silvery-white metalloid that is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. 1  It was discovered in 1782 by Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein in a gold ore from Transylvania and named in 1798 by Martin Heinrich Klaproth after the Latin word "tellus," meaning "Earth." 2  Tellurium is found in various sulfide minerals and is often obtained as a byproduct of copper and lead refining. 3  While it has properties intermediate between metals and nonmetals, it is generally considered a semiconductor. 1  Tellurium's primary application is in alloys, where it improves machinability of steel and copper, and in lead alloys, where it increases strength and resistance to corrosion. 4  It is also crucial in the production of cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells, a significant technology in renewable energy. 5  Tellurium compounds are used as vulcanizing agents in rubber production, as catalysts in petroleum refining, and in certain types of glass and ceramics to impart color. 6  Bismuth telluride is a thermoelectric material used in cooling and power generation devices. 7  Organotellurium compounds are being researched for potential applications in medicine and as catalysts in organic synthesis. 8  Despite its toxicity and relatively limited abundance, tellurium plays a vital role in various industrial and technological applications, particularly in materials science and renewable energy. 9
