        Moscovium (Mc, atomic number 115) is a synthetic, superheavy element that was first created in 2003 through a collaboration between Russian scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) and American scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). It was produced by bombarding atoms of americium-243 with calcium-48 ions, resulting in a few atoms of moscovium that existed for only a fraction of a second before decaying. The discovery was confirmed in the following years, and in 2016, the element was officially named moscovium by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in honor of the Moscow region, where JINR is located. Moscovium is part of Group 15 in the periodic table, placing it in the same group as nitrogen and bismuth, though its chemical properties are not well understood due to its short half-life and limited production. Like other superheavy elements, moscovium has no practical applications because of its extreme instability and the difficulty of producing it in measurable amounts. However, it is valuable to scientific research, especially in advancing our understanding of nuclear reactions, atomic behavior at high atomic numbers, and the pursuit of discovering longer-lived elements within the predicted "island of stability."
