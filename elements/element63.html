        Europium, element number 63 with the symbol Eu, is a soft, silvery-white metal belonging to the lanthanide series of rare earth elements. 1  It was discovered in 1896 by French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected its presence as a contaminant in samarium samples, and he successfully isolated it in a reasonably pure form in 1901, naming it after the continent of Europe. 2  Europium is the most reactive, least dense, and softest among the lanthanides, readily oxidizing in air and reacting with water much like calcium; it is soft enough to be cut with a knife and should be stored under a non-reactive fluid due to its high reactivity. While it is one of the least abundant rare earth elements, primarily found in minerals like monazite and bastnasite, europium has become indispensable in several high-tech applications due to its unique optical and magnetic properties. Its primary use is in red and blue phosphors for television and computer screens (particularly cathode ray tubes, LCDs, and OLEDs), LED lighting, and fluorescent lamps, contributing to vibrant color reproduction and energy efficiency. Europium compounds are also crucial in anti-counterfeiting measures, such as in euro banknotes where they glow red under UV light, and in security documents. Additionally, europium's strong neutron absorption cross-section makes it valuable in control rods for nuclear reactors, and its luminescent properties are utilized in medical imaging as contrast agents and in X-ray intensifying screens. 3  Furthermore, europium is explored for potential uses in quantum computing, solid-state lasers, and as a dopant in certain plastics for lasers and in superconducting alloys. 4
