        Thallium, element 81 with the symbol Tl, is a soft, silvery-white post-transition metal that tarnishes to bluish-gray in air and was discovered in 1861 by William Crookes through its characteristic bright green spectral line, hence its name from the Greek "thallos" meaning "green shoot." Primarily obtained as a byproduct of smelting sulfide ores and sulfuric acid production, thallium compounds, notably thallium sulfate, were historically infamously used as potent and tasteless rodenticides and insecticides, applications now largely banned due to their extreme human and environmental toxicity. Despite its dangers, thallium finds modern niche uses in specialized high-refractive-index glasses for optics, as a component in semiconductor materials and switches, in photocells and gamma radiation detectors, in some low-melting alloys, and as a catalyst in certain chemical processes; furthermore, the radioactive isotope thallium-201 is utilized in cardiac stress tests in medicine, highlighting a stark contrast between its toxic nature and specific technological and medical applications, all while necessitating strict regulation and careful handling due to its significant health hazards, including its ability to mimic potassium in the body and cause severe neurological and other systemic damage.
