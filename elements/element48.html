        <h1>Cadmium (Cd)</h1>
        <img src="Cadmium_image.jpg" alt="Cadmium">
        <p>Cadmium is a soft, bluish-white, toxic transition metal with the atomic number 48 and the symbol Cd. It was discovered in 1817 by the German chemists Friedrich Strohmeyer and Karl Samuel Leberecht Hermann, who identified it in zinc ores. The name "cadmium" is derived from the Latin word *cadmia*, which was an ancient term for calamine (zinc carbonate), the ore from which cadmium was first isolated. Although cadmium is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, it is usually found as a byproduct of zinc, lead, and copper mining, as it often occurs in ores that contain these metals.

            Cadmium is highly toxic, and exposure to the metal or its compounds can have serious health effects, particularly on the kidneys, liver, and bones. Because of its toxicity, cadmium has been regulated in many countries, and its use is limited or closely monitored in many industries. Despite this, cadmium is still used in a variety of industrial and technological applications.
            
            One of the most important uses of cadmium is in the production of rechargeable nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries. These batteries have been widely used in portable electronic devices, power tools, and other applications where reliable, rechargeable power is needed. However, due to the environmental concerns surrounding cadmiumâ€™s toxicity, there has been a shift toward using other types of batteries, such as lithium-ion batteries, which do not contain cadmium.
            
            Cadmium is also used in the manufacturing of certain alloys, particularly those used in the aerospace and electronics industries. Cadmium alloys are valued for their resistance to corrosion, especially in harsh environments, making them useful in applications such as aircraft components, electrical connectors, and solders. Cadmium plating is also used to protect metals from rust and corrosion, particularly in components that need to withstand high levels of wear and exposure to the elements, such as automotive parts and electrical equipment.
            
            In addition to its industrial uses, cadmium compounds have been employed in the production of pigments, particularly in the creation of vibrant yellow, red, and orange colors. These cadmium-based pigments were historically used in paints, ceramics, and plastics. However, due to the health risks associated with cadmium, the use of these pigments has been increasingly restricted in favor of safer alternatives.
            
            Cadmium is also used in certain types of solar cells, particularly thin-film solar cells made from cadmium telluride (CdTe). These solar panels are valued for their cost-effectiveness and efficiency, though they have been the subject of concern due to the toxic nature of cadmium. Researchers continue to explore ways to mitigate the environmental impact of cadmium in solar cell production and disposal.
            
            Biologically, cadmium has no known beneficial role in living organisms, and it is considered highly toxic to humans. Chronic exposure to cadmium, even at low levels, can cause serious health problems. Cadmium exposure has been linked to kidney damage, bone demineralization, respiratory issues, and an increased risk of cancer. It is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Most exposure occurs through contaminated food, water, air, and occupational settings, particularly in industries involving metal mining, battery manufacturing, or painting.
            
            Overall, while cadmium has some useful applications, its toxicity and environmental impact have led to increasing regulation and efforts to reduce its use. Alternatives to cadmium in batteries, pigments, and other products are being developed to minimize the health and environmental risks associated with this metal.
