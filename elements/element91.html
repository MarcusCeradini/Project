        Protactinium is a rare and highly radioactive metallic element with the symbol Pa and atomic number 91, found in the actinide series of the periodic table. It was first identified in the early 20th century by several scientists, but it was officially named in 1918 by Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner. The name “protactinium” comes from the Greek "protos," meaning "first," and “actinium,” because it is the precursor of actinium in the radioactive decay series. Protactinium occurs naturally in very small amounts in uranium ores, such as pitchblende, and is typically extracted as a byproduct of uranium processing. It exists primarily as the isotope protactinium-231, which has a half-life of about 32,760 years. Protactinium is silvery-gray in appearance, very dense, and highly toxic due to its intense radioactivity. Because of its rarity, high cost, and difficulty of handling, protactinium has very limited practical uses. However, it has been used in scientific research, particularly in the study of nuclear reactions and radioactive decay. During the mid-20th century, it was also studied for potential applications in nuclear reactors, though safer and more abundant elements were favored. As one of the least abundant naturally occurring elements in the Earth's crust, protactinium remains mostly a subject of academic interest rather than industrial use. Handling it requires extreme precautions, and its study contributes valuable knowledge to the fields of nuclear chemistry and radiophysics.
