        Tungsten, element number 74 with the symbol W, is a rare, hard, and lustrous silvery-white metal with the highest melting point and the highest tensile strength of all elements, making it exceptionally valuable in high-temperature and high-stress applications. First identified as a new element in 1781 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and independently by Juan Jos√© and Fausto Elhuyar in 1783, who are credited with its isolation, its name originates from the Swedish "tung sten," meaning "heavy stone." Historically, tungsten's primary use was in filaments for incandescent light bulbs, a groundbreaking application that revolutionized lighting due to its ability to withstand high temperatures without melting. While LEDs and other lighting technologies are now more prevalent, tungsten filaments still find use in specialized applications. Today, tungsten's exceptional properties make it crucial in a wide array of industries. Its hardness leads to its use in wear-resistant materials, such as cemented carbides (often called "carbide" or "Widia") used in cutting tools, drill bits, and wear parts in mining and construction. Its high density makes it suitable for counterweights, radiation shielding, and projectiles. In electronics, tungsten is used in contacts, electrodes, and heating elements. Its high melting point is essential in welding electrodes and high-temperature alloys, particularly in aerospace for turbine blades and nozzles. Furthermore, tungsten compounds are used as catalysts and in the production of certain paints and ceramics. Primarily sourced from ores like wolframite and scheelite found in China, Russia, Canada, and other countries, tungsten's unique combination of extreme hardness, high melting point, and density ensures its continued importance in numerous demanding technological and industrial applications.
