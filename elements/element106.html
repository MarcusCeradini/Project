        Seaborgium (Sg, atomic number 106) is a synthetic, superheavy element named in honor of American chemist **Glenn T. Seaborg**, who made significant contributions to the development of the actinide series in the periodic table. It was first synthesized in **1974** by a team of scientists at the **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in California, USA, by bombarding **curium-242** with **oxygen-18** ions. This process produced a few atoms of seaborgium, which decayed almost immediately. The discovery was confirmed in subsequent experiments, and in **1994**, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) officially named the element seaborgium in recognition of Seaborg's pioneering work in nuclear chemistry. Seaborgium is part of **Group 6** on the periodic table, alongside elements like **chromium**, **molybdenum**, and **tungsten**, and it is expected to share some properties with these elements. However, its chemical behavior is not well understood due to its extreme instability, with its half-life being measured in milliseconds. As a result, seaborgium has no known practical applications. Despite this, its synthesis contributes to research in nuclear physics, helping scientists study the properties of superheavy elements, nuclear stability, and the potential for discovering longer-lived elements in the theorized **"island of stability."**
