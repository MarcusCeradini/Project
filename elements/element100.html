        Fermium (Fm, atomic number 100) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after physicist **Enrico Fermi**, a pioneer in nuclear physics and the developer of the first nuclear reactor. It was discovered in **1952** by a team of American scientists who were analyzing the debris from the first hydrogen bomb test, known as **Ivy Mike**, conducted in the Pacific Ocean. Fermium was identified when **uranium** in the bomb's fuel absorbed multiple neutrons and underwent a series of nuclear reactions. It was later produced in laboratories by bombarding lighter actinides like **plutonium** with neutrons in nuclear reactors. Fermium belongs to the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. Like other heavy actinides, it is highly radioactive and has no stable isotopes, with its most stable form, fermium-257, having a half-life of about 100 days. Due to the difficulty in producing it and its radioactivity, fermium has no commercial applications and is used only in scientific research. Its discovery and study have helped scientists better understand nuclear reactions, neutron capture, and the limits of the periodic table.
