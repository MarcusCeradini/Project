        Rhodium, element number 45 with the symbol Rh, is a hard, silvery-white, and highly reflective transition metal belonging to the platinum group. 1  It was discovered in 1803 by English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, shortly after his discovery of palladium, from a sample of platinum ore obtained from South America; he named it after the Greek word "rhodon," meaning "rose," due to the red color of some of its compounds. 2  Rhodium is one of the rarest non-radioactive metals and is exceptionally corrosion-resistant, not tarnishing in air even at high temperatures. 3  Its primary application, accounting for the majority of its demand, is in catalytic converters for automobiles, where it plays a crucial role in reducing nitrogen oxides (NOx) in exhaust gases. Beyond automotive uses, rhodium is employed as a hardening agent in alloys with platinum and palladium, enhancing their corrosion resistance and high-temperature stability, which are essential in applications such as furnace windings, aircraft spark plug electrodes, and laboratory crucibles. Its high reflectivity and resistance to tarnishing also make it valuable for coatings on jewelry, mirrors, and optical instruments. Rhodium is also used as a catalyst in various industrial chemical processes, including the production of acetic and nitric acids. Due to its rarity and crucial industrial applications, rhodium is one of the most expensive precious metals. 4  Â
