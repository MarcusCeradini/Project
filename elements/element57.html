        Lanthanum, element number 57 with the symbol La, is a soft, silvery-white, ductile, and malleable rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. 1  It was discovered in 1839 by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander, who isolated it from cerium nitrate and named it from the Greek word "lanthanein," meaning "to lie hidden," as it was concealed within cerium. 2  Lanthanum is found in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite and is obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. 2  It is a reactive metal that slowly tarnishes in air, forming an oxide layer, and reacts readily with water and acids. 3  Despite being the namesake of the lanthanide series, lanthanum has a variety of applications. 3  One significant use is in the production of nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which are used in hybrid vehicles and portable electronic devices. 4  Lanthanum compounds are also used in high-quality optical lenses to improve their refractive index and reduce dispersion, in certain types of glass, and as catalysts in petroleum refining and various chemical processes. 5  Lanthanum oxide is used in camera lenses and as an additive to glass to enhance its alkali resistance. 6  Additionally, lanthanum is used in carbon arc lamps for studio lighting and projection, and its compounds are explored for potential applications in superconductors and phosphors. 7  While not as widely recognized as some other rare earth elements, lanthanum plays a crucial role in several key technologies.
