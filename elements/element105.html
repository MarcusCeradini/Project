        Dubnium (Db, atomic number 105) is a synthetic, superheavy element named after the Russian city of **Dubna**, where the **Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR)** is located. It was first synthesized in **1967** by scientists at JINR in collaboration with researchers at the **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in California, USA, by bombarding **californium-252** with **neon-22** ions. The experiment produced a few atoms of dubnium, which decayed rapidly. The discovery was confirmed in subsequent experiments, and in **1997**, the **International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)** officially named the element dubnium in recognition of the city. Dubnium is part of **Group 5** on the periodic table, alongside elements like **vanadium**, **niobium**, and **tantalum**, and is predicted to share some chemical properties with these elements, although its behavior is not well understood due to its short half-life. Like other superheavy elements, dubnium has an extremely brief existence—on the order of milliseconds—which limits its study and practical use. Its creation, however, contributes to ongoing research in nuclear physics and the study of the **"island of stability,"** where scientists hope to find more stable superheavy elements.
