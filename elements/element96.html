        Curium (Cm, atomic number 96) is a synthetic, radioactive element named in honor of pioneering scientists **Marie and Pierre Curie** for their groundbreaking work on radioactivity. It was first synthesized in **1944** by Glenn T. Seaborg, Ralph A. James, and Albert Ghiorso at the **University of California, Berkeley**, by bombarding **plutonium-239** with **alpha particles** (helium nuclei) in a cyclotron. Curium is part of the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. It shares chemical properties with other actinides like **americium** and **berkelium**. Its most commonly used isotope, **curium-244**, is a strong **alpha emitter** and has been used as a power source in **radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)** for space missions, such as in satellites and deep-space probes. Despite its potential uses, curium is highly radioactive and toxic, requiring careful handling and containment. It is produced only in small amounts in specialized nuclear reactors or particle accelerators. While it has limited practical applications, curium is valuable for research in nuclear science and has contributed significantly to the study of heavy elements and nuclear reactions.
