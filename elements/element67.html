        <p>Hydrogen, with the symbol H and atomic number 1, is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe, making up about 75% of all normal matter by mass. It is a colorless, odorless, and highly flammable gas at room temperature. Hydrogen is a key building block in the formation of stars and galaxies and is primarily found in the Sun and other stars, where nuclear fusion processes convert hydrogen into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy. On Earth, hydrogen is mainly found in water (Hâ‚‚O) and organic compounds. Its uses are diverse: hydrogen is a crucial component in the production of ammonia for fertilizers, as a fuel in hydrogen fuel cells for clean energy, and in various industrial processes like petroleum refining. Historically, hydrogen was first identified in the 16th century and was later recognized as a distinct element by scientists like Henry Cavendish in the late 18th century. With the rise of clean energy technologies, hydrogen is gaining attention as a potential alternative fuel source to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and combat climate change.
