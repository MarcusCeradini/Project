        Holmium, element number 67 with the symbol Ho, is a relatively soft, malleable, and ductile silvery-white rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. It was discovered in 1878 by the Swiss chemist Jacques-Louis Soret and named after "Holmia," the Latin name for Stockholm, Sweden. Holmium occurs in minerals such as monazite and gadolinite and is one of the less abundant lanthanides. It tarnishes slowly in air and reacts with dilute acids. While holmium has fewer widespread commercial applications compared to some other rare earth elements, its unique magnetic properties and spectral characteristics lend it to specific niche uses. Holmium has the highest magnetic moment of any element, making it valuable in creating strong magnetic fields, particularly in research and specialized applications. It is used as a dopant in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, finding applications in medical and dental surgery, as well as in materials processing. Holmium oxide is used to color glass and cubic zirconia yellow or pink. Additionally, holmium is being explored for its potential in data storage and as a neutron absorber in nuclear control rods. Its distinct spectral absorption bands also make it useful in calibrating spectrophotometers. Although its overall consumption is lower due to its scarcity, holmium's unique magnetic and optical properties make it important in certain advanced technologies and scientific research.
