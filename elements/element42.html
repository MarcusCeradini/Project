        Molybdenum, element number 42 with the symbol Mo, is a silvery-white, hard, and refractory transition metal, notable for its high melting point and excellent strength at elevated temperatures. 1  The soft, black mineral molybdenite (molybdenum disulfide, MoS₂) was historically mistaken for graphite or lead ore until 1778, when Carl Wilhelm Scheele identified it as a distinct element, though the pure metal wasn't isolated until 1781 by Peter Jacob Hjelm. 1  Molybdenum does not occur natively and is primarily obtained from molybdenite, as well as from wulfenite (PbMoO₄) and powellite (Ca(MoW)O₄), and as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining. Its resistance to corrosion, high thermal and electrical conductivity, and low thermal expansion make it invaluable in numerous industrial applications. The majority of molybdenum is used as an alloying agent in steel, enhancing its strength, hardness, toughness, corrosion resistance, and weldability, making it crucial in structural steels, stainless steels, tool steels, and high-speed steels used in automotive components, construction, and high-temperature environments like jet engines. Molybdenum compounds also serve as important catalysts in the petroleum industry for removing sulfur from fuels and in the production of polymers, as well as lubricants (molybdenum disulfide), pigments in paints and inks, and even essential micronutrients in fertilizers for certain plants. 2  Its unique properties ensure molybdenum's continued importance in metallurgy, chemical processing, electronics, and even biological systems. 3
