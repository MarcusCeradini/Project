        Cerium, element number 58 with the symbol Ce, is a soft, silvery, ductile metal belonging to the lanthanide series of rare earth elements. 1  It was the first lanthanide to be discovered, identified in 1803 independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth and Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger; Klaproth named it "ceria" after the newly discovered asteroid Ceres, while Berzelius and Hisinger proposed "cerium." 2  The name "cerium" was eventually adopted. Cerium is the most abundant of the rare earth elements, found in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite, and is obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. It is highly reactive, readily tarnishing in air to form a mixture of oxides, and it reacts with water and acids. 3  Cerium has a wide range of applications due to its unique chemical and physical properties. 4  Cerium oxide (ceria) is a crucial component in catalytic converters in automobiles, where it helps to reduce carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons in exhaust gases. 5  It is also used as a polishing agent for glass lenses and mirrors, and in UV-absorbing coatings for glass. 6  Cerium is a component of mischmetal, which is used in lighter flints. 7  In metallurgy, cerium is added to certain aluminum alloys to improve their strength and castability, and to cast iron to counteract the effects of sulfur and produce a more malleable iron. Cerium compounds are also used in phosphors for fluorescent lighting and in some colored glasses and ceramics. 8  Its ability to exist in both +3 and +4 oxidation states contributes to its versatility in various chemical and industrial processes. 9
