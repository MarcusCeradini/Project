        Mendelevium (Md, atomic number 101) is a synthetic, radioactive element named in honor of **Dmitri Mendeleev**, the Russian chemist who created the periodic table. It was first synthesized in **1955** by scientists at the **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in California, including Glenn T. Seaborg and Albert Ghiorso. The team produced mendelevium by bombarding **einsteinium-253** with **alpha particles (helium-4 nuclei)**, creating just a few atoms of the new element. As part of the **actinide series**, mendelevium is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table and is chemically similar to other actinides like **americium** and **curium**. Due to its extremely short half-life and the tiny amounts in which it can be produced, mendelevium has no practical applications outside of scientific research. Its study is mainly focused on understanding the properties of heavy elements, the structure of atomic nuclei, and the forces that hold them together. The synthesis of mendelevium marked an important milestone in the development of superheavy elements and nuclear chemistry.
