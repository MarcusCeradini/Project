        Samarium, element number 62 with the symbol Sm, is a moderately hard, silvery-white metal belonging to the lanthanide series of rare earth elements. It was spectroscopically discovered in 1879 by the French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who named it after the mineral samarskite, which was itself named after a Russian mine official. Samarium is found in minerals such as monazite and bastnasite and is typically obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction processes. It is relatively stable in air at room temperature, though it slowly oxidizes to form samarium(III) oxide (Sm₂O₃), and it readily dissolves in most dilute acids. Samarium has several notable applications stemming from its magnetic and neutron-absorbing properties. Samarium-cobalt (SmCo) alloys are used to create powerful permanent magnets with high resistance to demagnetization and excellent stability at high temperatures, making them crucial in applications like headphones, small motors, and high-performance machinery. Additionally, samarium-149 has a high neutron capture cross-section, leading to its use in control rods for nuclear reactors. Samarium oxide is employed in specialized infrared-absorbing glass and as a catalyst in certain chemical reactions, such as the dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Furthermore, the radioactive isotope samarium-153 is used in targeted radionuclide therapy to treat bone cancer pain.
