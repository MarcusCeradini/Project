        Nobelium (No, atomic number 102) is a synthetic, actinide element named in honor of **Alfred Nobel**, the inventor of dynamite and the founder of the Nobel Prize. It was first synthesized in **1957** by a team of scientists at the **Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory** in California, USA, who produced nobelium by bombarding **curium-244** with **carbon-12** ions. However, the discovery was initially disputed, and it was later confirmed by other teams, particularly researchers in **Russia**. In **1997**, the **International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)** officially recognized the element and named it nobelium. Nobelium is part of the **actinide series** and is found in **Period 7** of the periodic table, alongside other heavy elements like **californium** and **berkelium**. Its chemical properties are expected to be similar to other actinides, but due to its extreme instability and short half-life (measured in minutes), it has not been studied extensively. As a result, nobelium has no known practical applications. However, its creation has been significant for nuclear research, contributing to the study of heavy elements, nuclear forces, and the limits of the periodic table, as well as the search for more stable superheavy elements in the theorized **"island of stability."**
