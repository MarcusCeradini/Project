        Zirconium, element number 40 with the symbol Zr, is a lustrous, grayish-white transition metal renowned for its exceptional resistance to corrosion, even by strong acids, alkalis, and seawater, due to the formation of a protective oxide layer. 1  Discovered in 1789 by German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in the mineral zircon (ZrSiO₄), and first isolated in an impure form in 1824 by Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, pure ductile zirconium wasn't produced until 1925. 2  Zirconium is primarily obtained from the minerals zircon and baddeleyite, with major mining operations in Australia and South Africa. 3  A key application of zirconium stems from its very low neutron absorption cross-section, making it indispensable as a cladding material for fuel rods in nuclear reactors, where it ensures efficient nuclear fission and protects the coolant from contamination; this use accounts for a significant portion of global zirconium production. 1  Beyond nuclear energy, zirconium's corrosion resistance and biocompatibility lead to its use in chemical processing equipment, medical implants like dental crowns and hip replacements, and even in high-performance alloys for aerospace applications. 4  Zirconium oxide (zirconia) is valued for its hardness and high melting point, finding use in ultra-strong ceramics for cutting tools, abrasives, and furnace linings, as well as a popular diamond simulant in jewelry known as cubic zirconia. 5  Additionally, zirconium compounds are utilized in cosmetics, antiperspirants, food packaging, and as pigments in ceramics, showcasing the element's diverse applications arising from its unique combination of chemical and physical properties. 6
