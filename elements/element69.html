        Thulium, element number 69 with the symbol Tm, is a soft, silvery-gray rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. It was discovered in 1879 by the Swedish chemist Per Teodor Cleve, who named it after Thule, the ancient Greek and Roman name for a mythical northern land, often associated with Scandinavia. Thulium is the least abundant of the naturally occurring lanthanides and is typically found in small quantities in minerals like monazite. It is relatively soft, malleable, and ductile, and it tarnishes slowly in air. While its overall commercial applications are somewhat limited due to its scarcity and high cost of extraction, thulium has some specialized uses. One notable application is as a radiation source in portable X-ray devices, particularly the radioactive isotope thulium-170, which emits relatively low-energy gamma rays, making it suitable for medical and dental radiography in remote locations. Thulium is also used as a dopant in yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) lasers, producing light at a wavelength that is efficiently absorbed by water, making these lasers useful in medical and dental surgery for precise tissue ablation. Additionally, thulium can be used in certain blue phosphors and as a neutron source in portable radiography. Its potential applications in solid-state lasers and magnetic materials are also being explored, highlighting its value in specialized technological and medical fields despite its low natural abundance.
