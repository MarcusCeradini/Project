        Gadolinium, element number 64 with the symbol Gd, is a silvery-white, moderately soft and ductile rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. It was spectroscopically discovered in 1880 by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, who identified it as an impurity in samarium, and the element was named after the mineral gadolinite, which in turn was named after the Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin. Gadolinium is found in minerals like monazite and bastnasite and is typically obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. Notably, gadolinium has the highest thermal neutron capture cross-section of any element, making it highly valuable in control rods for nuclear reactors to regulate the rate of fission. Its paramagnetic properties are also crucial in medicine, where chelated gadolinium compounds are widely used as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to enhance the visibility of internal tissues and organs. Furthermore, gadolinium is utilized in alloys to improve workability and resistance to high temperatures and oxidation, in the production of phosphors for various display technologies, and in specialized optical and electronic devices, highlighting its diverse applications stemming from its unique nuclear and magnetic characteristics.
