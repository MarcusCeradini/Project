        <p>Manganese (Mn), with atomic number 25, is a hard, brittle, gray-white metal that plays a crucial role in a variety of industrial applications due to its strength, flexibility, and ability to improve the properties of alloys. It was first discovered in 1774 by Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and later isolated by Johann Gottlieb Gahn in 1779. Manganese is primarily obtained from minerals like pyrolusite and is essential in the production of steel, where it is added to improve hardness, tensile strength, and resistance to impact. Manganese alloys, particularly high-manganese steel, are used in heavy-duty applications like railroad tracks, machinery parts, and mining equipment. It is also a key component in batteries, such as alkaline and lithium-ion batteries, where it improves energy density and longevity. Manganese compounds, such as manganese dioxide (MnO₂), are used as catalysts in chemical reactions, particularly in the production of oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, and in the manufacturing of dry-cell batteries. In addition, manganese sulfate is used in the agricultural industry as a micronutrient to prevent deficiency in crops, and potassium permanganate (KMnO₄) serves as a disinfectant and water purifier. Biologically, manganese is an essential trace element in humans, playing a critical role in bone formation, metabolism, and antioxidant defense, though excessive exposure can lead to toxicity, causing neurological issues. Manganese’s versatility across industries, from steelmaking and battery production to agriculture and medicine, makes it a vital element in modern technology and industry.
