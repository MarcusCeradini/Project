        Yttrium, element number 39 with the symbol Y, is a silvery-metallic transition metal that is chemically similar to the lanthanides (rare earth elements) and is often classified as one. 1  It was discovered in 1789 by Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin in the mineral ytterbite (later renamed gadolinite) and named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden, which is also the namesake for erbium, terbium, and ytterbium. 2  Yttrium is found in most rare earth minerals and is primarily obtained as a byproduct of lanthanide extraction. While not as widely recognized as some other elements, yttrium has several important applications. 3  One of its most significant uses is in the production of phosphors, particularly red phosphors used in television screens and LED lighting, where yttrium oxide and yttrium vanadate are common compounds. 2  Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystals, doped with elements like neodymium or erbium, are crucial in various types of lasers used in industrial cutting, welding, and medical procedures. 4  Yttrium oxide is also used to stabilize the cubic form of zirconia, creating cubic zirconia gemstones, which are popular diamond simulants. Additionally, yttrium is used in some high-temperature superconductors and in certain metal alloys to improve their strength and corrosion resistance, particularly in aerospace applications. Its compounds also find niche uses as catalysts in polymerization reactions and in the production of microwave filters. Despite its relatively low abundance compared to some other metals, yttrium's unique optical and material properties make it essential in various high-technology applications. Â
