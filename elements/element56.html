        Barium, element number 56 with the symbol Ba, is a soft, silvery-white alkaline earth metal that is never found in nature in its pure elemental form due to its high reactivity with air and water; it was first identified as a new element in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and isolated in 1808 by Sir Humphry Davy through electrolysis of molten barium salts, its name derived from the Greek word "barys," meaning "heavy," referring to the high density of its minerals. Barium compounds have a wide range of applications, most notably barium sulfate (BaSO₄), which, due to its opacity to X-rays, is ingested or administered as a "barium meal" or "barium enema" to enhance the visibility of the digestive tract in medical imaging. Barium chloride (BaCl₂) is used in pyrotechnics to produce a vibrant green color, and barium nitrate (Ba(NO₃)₂) serves a similar purpose in green signal flares. Lithopone, a pigment consisting of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide, was once widely used in paints. Barium carbonate (BaCO₃) is employed in rat poison, in the manufacture of certain types of glass, and in the production of barium titanate, a ferroelectric material used in capacitors. Despite the toxicity of many barium compounds (soluble barium salts are poisonous), their unique chemical and physical properties make them essential in various industrial, medical, and pyrotechnic applications.
