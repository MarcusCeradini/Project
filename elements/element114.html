            Flerovium (Fl, atomic number 114) is a synthetic, superheavy element first created in 1998 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, in collaboration with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in the United States. It was produced by bombarding plutonium-244 with calcium-48 ions, resulting in a few atoms that decayed in seconds or less. The discovery was confirmed in the early 2000s, and in 2012, the element was officially named flerovium by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in honor of the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, which itself was named after physicist Georgy Flerov. Flerovium is part of Group 14 in the periodic table, which includes carbon and lead, though its chemical behavior is still uncertain due to its instability and limited data. It was once predicted to be a possible noble metal or even a gas under standard conditions due to relativistic effects, but recent research suggests it may behave more like a metal. Flerovium has no practical uses because of its extremely short half-life and the difficulty in producing it, but it is important to scientists studying the properties of superheavy elements and the theoretical “island of stability,” where some heavy elements might exhibit longer lifespans and unique behaviors.
