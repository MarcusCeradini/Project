        Erbium, element number 68 with the symbol Er, is a soft, malleable, and ductile silvery-white rare earth metal belonging to the lanthanide series. It was discovered in 1843 by Carl Gustaf Mosander, who named it after the village of Ytterby in Sweden, the same source for the names of yttrium, terbium, and ytterbium. Erbium occurs in several minerals, including gadolinite, xenotime, and euxenite. While it tarnishes slowly in air and reacts slowly with water and acids, its most significant application lies in fiber optic technology. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) are crucial components in long-distance optical communication systems, as erbium ions emit light at a wavelength of around 1.54 micrometers, which corresponds to a low-loss transmission window in silica-based optical fibers, allowing for signal amplification without the need for electronic repeaters over vast distances. Beyond telecommunications, erbium has applications in lasers, particularly in medical and dental fields, where erbium lasers (such as Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG) are used for precise tissue ablation in dermatological resurfacing, dental procedures, and surgical applications due to their strong absorption by water. Erbium compounds are also used in some nuclear control rods and as a dopant in certain glasses and phosphors. Although not as widely recognized as some other rare earth elements, erbium plays a vital role in enabling modern global communication networks and in specific medical technologies.
