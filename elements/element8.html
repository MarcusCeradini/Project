        <p>Oxygen, with the symbol O and atomic number 8, is a highly reactive element essential for life on Earth. It is colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and makes up about 21% of the Earth's atmosphere. Oxygen is crucial for respiration in most living organisms, as it is used to produce energy in cells through a process called cellular respiration. It is also a vital component of water (Hâ‚‚O) and many organic and inorganic compounds. In addition to its biological importance, oxygen has widespread industrial uses: it is used in the production of steel and other metals, in medical applications for patients with respiratory issues, and in the production of chemicals like hydrogen peroxide. Oxygen is also a key part of combustion, supporting fire and energy production. Historically, oxygen was first identified by Joseph Priestley and Carl Wilhelm Scheele in the 1770s, though Priestley is credited with its discovery. Oxygen's role in supporting life and its presence in countless chemical reactions has made it one of the most essential elements for both life and industry.
