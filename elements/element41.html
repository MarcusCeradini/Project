        Niobium, element number 41 with the symbol Nb, is a soft, gray, ductile transition metal that often occurs in the minerals columbite and tantalite, frequently alongside tantalum. 1  It was discovered in 1801 by the English chemist Charles Hatchett, who named it "columbium" after the mineral it was found in, but the element was later independently rediscovered in 1846 by German chemist Heinrich Rose, who named it "niobium" after Niobe, the daughter of Tantalus in Greek mythology; the name niobium was officially adopted internationally in 1949. Niobium has a high melting point and is superconducting at cryogenic temperatures. 2  Its primary application is in the production of high-strength, low-alloy steels, where it enhances strength, toughness, weldability, and corrosion resistance, making it crucial in pipelines, structural steel, and automotive components. Niobium alloys, particularly with nickel, chromium, and aluminum, are used in jet engine components and gas turbines due to their high-temperature strength. 3  Its superconducting properties lead to its use in superconducting magnets for MRI machines, particle accelerators, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) equipment. Niobium compounds are also used in capacitors in electronic devices due to their high capacitance per unit volume, and niobium oxide is used in specialized optical glasses. 4  Its biocompatibility makes it suitable for certain medical implants. 5  While not as abundant as some other metals, niobium's unique combination of properties makes it essential in various advanced technological and industrial applications.
