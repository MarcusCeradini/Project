        Neptunium (Np, atomic number 93) is a synthetic, radioactive element named after the planet **Neptune**, following the naming of **uranium** (after Uranus). It was the first transuranic element discovered, synthesized in **1940** by Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson at the **University of California, Berkeley**. They created neptunium by bombarding **uranium-238** with **neutrons**, which resulted in the formation of neptunium-239. Neptunium belongs to the **actinide series** and is located in **Period 7** of the periodic table. It exhibits several oxidation states and is chemically similar to uranium and plutonium. Although neptunium has no significant commercial uses, it has potential applications in the nuclear industry. For example, **neptunium-237** can be used in **neutron detectors** and may serve as a precursor for producing **plutonium-238**, which powers spacecraft. Due to its radioactivity and long half-life, neptunium is also studied for its behavior in **nuclear waste management** and **reactor fuel cycles**. Its discovery marked the beginning of the exploration of elements beyond uranium and opened the door to the development of heavier synthetic elements.
