        Neodymium, element number 60 with the symbol Nd, is a soft, silvery metallic rare earth element belonging to the lanthanide series. It was independently discovered in 1885 by the Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach and the French chemist Georges Urbain; Welsbach named it from the Greek words "neos didymos," meaning "new twin," as it was found as a component of didymium, which was previously thought to be a single element. Neodymium is found in various minerals such as monazite and bastnasite and is obtained through ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. It readily oxidizes in air, forming an oxide layer that gives it a tarnish. Neodymium's most significant application is in the production of powerful permanent magnets, particularly neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which possess the highest magnetic strength of any permanent magnets known. These magnets are crucial components in a wide range of modern technologies, including electric motors in hybrid and electric vehicles, wind turbine generators, hard disk drives, loudspeakers, headphones, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines. Neodymium compounds are also used to color glass and ceramics, producing vibrant shades of violet, blue, and green; neodymium-doped glass is used in high-power lasers, such as those used in industrial cutting, welding, and medical procedures. Additionally, neodymium is used as a catalyst in certain polymerization reactions. Its unique magnetic and optical properties make it an indispensable material in clean energy technologies, electronics, and various industrial applications.
