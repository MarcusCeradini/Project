        <p>Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and mostly inert diatomic gas that makes up about 78% of Earthâ€™s atmosphere by volume, making it the most abundant uncombined element in our air. With the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7, nitrogen is a nonmetal that plays a vital role in the chemistry of life and the environment. Discovered in 1772 by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford, nitrogen was identified as the part of air that does not support combustion or life, and was later studied by other scientists like Antoine Lavoisier and Joseph Priestley. Nitrogen is essential to all living organisms, as it is a fundamental component of amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids like DNA and RNA. In nature, nitrogen cycles through the atmosphere, soil, and living organisms via the nitrogen cycle, where bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by plants. Industrially, nitrogen gas is produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air and is widely used in various fields: in food preservation (as a cooling agent and packaging gas), in the manufacture of ammonia (used for fertilizers via the Haber process), in electronics and pharmaceuticals, and as a shielding gas in welding. Liquid nitrogen, due to its extremely low temperature, is also used for cryogenic freezing, including in medical and scientific applications like cryopreservation and cryosurgery. Despite its abundance, atmospheric nitrogen cannot be used directly by most living organisms and must be "fixed" into compounds, emphasizing its unique and crucial role in sustaining life and technology.</p>
