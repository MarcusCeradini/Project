        Palladium, element number 46 with the symbol Pd, is a lustrous, silvery-white transition metal belonging to the platinum group. It was discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston, who named it after the asteroid Pallas. Palladium is found in its native form and in ores associated with platinum, nickel, and copper deposits. It shares many chemical properties with other platinum group metals but is the least dense and has the lowest melting point among them. A key characteristic of palladium is its ability to absorb significant amounts of hydrogen at room temperature. Its primary use today is in catalytic converters for automobiles, where it acts as a crucial catalyst in converting harmful pollutants like hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides into less harmful substances. Beyond automotive applications, palladium is used in electronics for multi-layer ceramic capacitors and as a plating material. It also finds applications in jewelry, sometimes as a substitute for platinum or in white gold alloys, as well as in dentistry for alloys used in crowns and bridges. Furthermore, palladium serves as a valuable catalyst in various chemical reactions, including hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes, and has niche uses in hydrogen purification and storage technologies.
